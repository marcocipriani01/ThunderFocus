// Shows how an I2C slave can listen to more than one address.
// This is handy if you want the Teensy to impersonate a lot of different devices.
//
// To use it, connect a master to the Teensy on pins 16 and 17.
// Use the master to query the Teensy on different addresses.
// The Teensy echoes the I2C address back to the master.
//
// This is an advanced example.
